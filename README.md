The dataset I'm using in this app is SAMPLE DATA from this IBM website:

### What you need:
1. Python 3
2. Matplotlib
3. Pandas
4. A dataset (included in the Data folder)

### How to:
1. Download or clone this repo.
2. run **python -m pip install -U matplotlib**
3. run **python -m install pandas**
4. **cd** to your working directory
5. Type **python cus_response_yes_no.py** on the terminal
6. Visualize the output data on terminal and in a bar plot or graph

This example count and shows the customers that response yes or no.
